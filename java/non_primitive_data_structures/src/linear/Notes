Java Exceptions:

Java class extends java.lang.Exceptions class.
We can also extend this class to in our, remember to call the super in your constructor, the call the extend
constructor.

Linklist:
Unlike array where elements are saved in a linear order and has a max/min size from the begging.
Linklist is here to solve that problem!!! ðŸ˜‚
Linked list/linklist all elements (nodes) are saved with a pointer to the next value.
First value is head, the last value tail.

See examples in none-liner.

We are going to use linklist in graphs, trees and many other data structure that we are going to build.
So Yes! Linklist is our foundations for learning datastructures and algorithms. ðŸ™„

Something to remember, only head the first element can show us where the next element is.


Boundary conditions:
    => Empty data structures
    => Single element in the data structures
    => Adding or removing from the beginning of data structure.
    => Adding or removing from the end of data structure.
    => Working in the middle

    You have to think about those boundary conditions regardless of the data structure when implementing a new method
    and how this will effect your data structure.
